## Overview

In this program, I learned the fundamentals of web development, including HTML, CSS, and Flexbox. I completed several projects and exercises to strengthen my skills in these areas. This repository serves as a portfolio of my work and progress throughout the course.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders:

- `css_advanced`: Contains code related to advanced CSS concepts and techniques.
- `css_basic`: Includes code related to basic CSS styling.
- `flexbox`: Contains projects and exercises focused on using Flexbox for responsive layouts.
- `html_advanced`: Contains code related to advanced HTML topics.
- `html_basic`: Includes code related to basic HTML structures.

## CSS Advanced

The `css_advanced` folder contains more complex CSS projects, where I explored advanced styling techniques, such as animations, transitions, and transformations. Each project has its own subfolder, and the code is well-documented for easy understanding.

## CSS Basic

In the `css_basic` folder, you'll find projects and exercises that cover foundational CSS concepts, like selectors, box model, positioning, and more.

## Flexbox

The `flexbox` folder showcases my work on various projects where I utilized Flexbox to create flexible and responsive layouts for different web pages.

## HTML Advanced

Inside the `html_advanced` folder, I worked on projects that involve advanced HTML structures, semantic elements, multimedia embedding, and other related topics.

## HTML Basic

The `html_basic` folder contains projects and exercises that cover the fundamentals of HTML, including tags, attributes, forms, and basic page structure.
